AirBnB clone - Web framework
For this part of the project, going back to our static webpages (see /web_static), we want to display the data we have stored (see /models/engine) and not fake values hard coded in the html pages.

This project is done in python.
The first 5 questions are an introduction to Flask.
The next 2 are in introduction to jinja.
The next questions are mixing jinja, Flask and the storage engine.
